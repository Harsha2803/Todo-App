http://Harsha2803.github.io/Todo-App

A website for organizing tasks (to-do list) built with React JS, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and more.

## Description

- This application allows you to organize your tasks with the following details: title, description, date, mark as complete, and mark as important.
- The tasks are organized into different routes: tasks for today, important tasks, incomplete tasks, complete tasks, all tasks, and tasks by directory (folder). Directories and tasks can be edited or deleted. Additionally, there is a main directory called "Main" that cannot be edited or deleted.
- The task list can be sorted by: closest due date, farthest due date, complete tasks, or incomplete tasks.
- You can also search for specific tasks using the search field.
- Tasks scheduled for today are shown in the user section and in notifications.
- Task, directory, and dark mode data are saved in the localStorage.
